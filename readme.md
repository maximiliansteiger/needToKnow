# Need To Know

### This is a collection of useful things that may help you to understand a bit more about the world of tec on a very basic level.

<br>

### Every topic is structured as follows: A brief explanation at the beginning of each topic is kept as [short and simple as possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). After reading it you should get a brief insight and understanding what it is about. Further information will be stored in a separate file, so the readme is readable. When clicking the "read more" link you will be redirected to the file about the topic. In this file you will find more information about the topic and links to other repos or external sources. Usually threre will be videos and artikle that dive deep in a certain subject. Some sections have a quiz to check if you know everything you shoud know.
